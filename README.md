![Visual-SLAM Developer Roadmap - 2022](./img/title.png)

> Roadmap to becoming a Visual-SLAM developer in 2022, inspired by [web-developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and [game-developer-roadmap](https://github.com/utilForever/game-developer-roadmap).

Visual-SLAM is a special case of '[Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)', which you use a camera device to gather exteroceptive sensory data. 

Below there is a set of charts demonstrating the topics you need to understand in Visual-SLAM, from an absolute beginner difficulty to getting ready to become a Visual-SLAM engineer / researcher.

<br>

***

Visual-SLAM is often portrayed as a rather difficult topic - many think good C++ programming skills and deep understanding of mathematics is necessary.

On the other hand, there are not many courses provided for beginners, especially in non-English languages. 

I made these charts to share my thoughts and experience on studying Visual-SLAM, and hopefully the beginner learners can get a grasp of where to start from.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Purpose of these Roadmaps</strong></h3>

> The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the general overview of Visual-SLAM, and to guide you if you are confused about where to start from. 

<h3 align="center"><strong>Note to Beginners</strong></h3>

> Acknowledge that SLAM has a relatively high entry barrier - it's not because of the requirement of undertanding difficult mathematics, but the requirement of equipping yourself with various types of skills. Don't feel overwhelmed - you don't need to learn everything if you are just getting started. Instead, enjoy the journey itself and progress topic by topic. The result will be very rewarding.

## ðŸš¦ Wrap Up

If you think any of the roadmaps can be improved, please do open a PR with any updates and submit any issues. Also, I will continue to improve this, so you might want to watch/star this repository to revisit.

> Also, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/changh95) and [blog](http://www.cv-learn.com) :smiley_cat:

## ðŸ™Œ Contribution

The roadmaps are built using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/). Project file can be found at `/project-files` directory. To modify any of the roadmaps, open Balsamiq, click **Project > Import > Mockup JSON**, it will open the roadmap for you, update it, upload and update the images in readme and create a PR.
